## Disclaimer

This project represents a very much first foray into Go, so probably is unidiomatic
in a number of important ways, and isn't currently that useful, though it is now being
used internally for a HyperCat service we are implementing.

## Usage

Usage examples to follow, when and if any useful examples are forthcoming.
